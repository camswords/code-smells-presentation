whats the goal of this presentation?

	I consider myself a software craftsman
		be passionate!
	expose you to code. everybody should read more code!
	
	work on your spidey sense
	
	i want to show you how to read between the lines of code
		little piece of learning that the code is trying to teach us
		
	this is not aimed at the beginner coder
	
	this will be an opinionated presentation
		feel free to disagree 
	
what is a code smell?

kind of like a code review

code journeys. should this be about the journey?
	red green... the refactor journey

can you smell yourself?
	can you smell your own code?

might have to define entity and value objects

trade off

in head: I have an idea of what this means
in code: does this reflect what I think in my head?
translation cost = high cost of understanding.

writing vs reading.
