change me!
	this will be an opinionated presentation
		feel free to push me, to disagree
		im not after consensus or agreement
		im interested in discussion and learning 
		
		
whats the goal of this presentation?

	understand the difference between good code and bad code

	I consider myself a software craftsman
		be passionate!
	expose you to code. everybody should read more code!
	
	work on your spidey sense
	
	
	
what is a code smell?

kind of like a code review

code journeys. should this be about the journey?
	red green... the refactor journey

can you smell yourself?
	can you smell your own code?

might have to define entity and value objects

trade off

in head: I have an idea of what this means
in code: does this reflect what I think in my head?
translation cost = high cost of understanding.

writing vs reading.
