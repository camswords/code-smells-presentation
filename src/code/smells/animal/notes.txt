take 1:
can imagine that the logic to fly/swim etc could be complicated.

- nasty if else (hard to add new type of movement)
- hard to make a animal swim or fly
- breaks the open-closed principle
- booleans arent very descriptive
- breaks the single responsibility principle

take 2:
does this solve our issues? NO!

- same problems
- anytime your object behaves entirely differently based on input data: new object!


take 3:

+ animal: simple interface
+ good names: specific, explicit. conveys more means, describes intent.
+ logic is in separate places (less conflicts, easier to unit test, easier to substitute etc).
+ note the job of a class
