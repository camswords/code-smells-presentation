take 1:

- cohesion has been affected (data, behaviour has been separated)
- encapsulation has been broken
- agent noun ("manager", "parser", "calculator", etc)
- feature envy
- aneamic classes / domain
- dont understand where behaviour lives - dont know where to find it
+ maybe there are multiple ways to do the calculation

take 2:
still broken encapsulation

+ better that its behind a method though

take 3:

+ cohesive
+ no longer anaemic
