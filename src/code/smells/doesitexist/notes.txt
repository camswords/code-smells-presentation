value readability over performance

we can always still solve the performance problem later (cache to remember cats?)

null is a poor tool for relaying information

we pass the view class two different types of object
	we expect it to behave differently based upon the input argument
	ah ha! new object
	
	
take 2:
	code now matches closer to what is inside your head
	faster to understand
