take 1:

+ we only need to access the database once. yay for performance!
- null is a poor tool for relaying information (what does it mean?)
- the view is overloaded. its has to behave two different ways - once for displaying a cat, once for displaying i cant find the cat
	new object!

value readability over performance?
	we can always still solve the performance problem later (cache to remember cats?)

take 2:
	code now matches closer to what is inside your head
	faster to understand
	performance problem could be solved by a cache (repository level)
