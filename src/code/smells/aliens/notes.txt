easy:

clear concepts
more code
more classes
easier to understand?
what did you learn?
	Alien
	teaching english
	Alien has two brains
		small fast one
			how much can it remember?
		big slow one
			slow to learn or slow to speak?
			how much can it remember?
		
was the trade off worth it?

hard:

+ less code!
- unneccesary code (in constructor)
- unfortunate logic about regurgitating the small fast brain
- the alien and the big slow brain are the same class
	- polutes the interface of the alien. (speak or regurgitate?)
- poor use of inheritance (behaves like?)
- less 'information'
