take 1:

important for a dog to know which leg is at which place in his body?

can a dog really have more/less than four legs? (more? never. less? unlikely, but possible)

+ its easy to add another leg to a dog. Do we need this?
- readability (the way you think about a dog isnt reflected in the code)

take 2:

explicit which legs are where on the dog.

+ clear that a dog only has 4 legs (readability)
- more code 
? how do we represent that a dog has lost a leg?

take 3:

like this!
